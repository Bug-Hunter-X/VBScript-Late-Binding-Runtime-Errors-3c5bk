Early Binding:  Declare the object type explicitly to prevent runtime errors. This allows the VBScript interpreter to check for method existence at compile time. 
```vbscript
Dim obj As Object
On Error Resume Next 'Handles potential errors during object creation
Set obj = CreateObject("Some.Object")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Could not create object: " & Err.Description
  WScript.Quit
End If
On Error GoTo 0 'Disable error handling
'Check if the method exists before calling it
If TypeName(obj) = "Some.Object" Then
  If obj.DoSomething Is Nothing Then
    MsgBox "Some.Object doesn't have a DoSomething method!"
  Else
    obj.DoSomething
  End If
End If 
```
